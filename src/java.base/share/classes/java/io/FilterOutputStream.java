 * way or providing additional functionality.

 * all methods of <code>OutputStream</code> with versions that pass
 * all requests to the underlying output stream. Subclasses of
 * <code>FilterOutputStream</code> may further override some of these
 * methods as well as provide additional methods and fields.
